# HTML-CSS-FORM

In this exercise I have created an HTML form that gathers a family history from a patient to later be processed and saved to state and  later persist in a database. 

The basic structure of the code is a table composed of 9 rows. The second-row houses 2 additional nested tables.

I used CSS class and element selectors to style elements that required identical styling. I also used id attributes for all elements that required a value to be captured. I used the camel case naming convention for the idâ€™s in anticipation that this code could easily be integrated with javasript, jQuery, React and all the other JavaScript libraries and of course getElementById( ).

I believe that this exercise tested my skills understanding HTML, CSS selectors, the CSS box model, element attributes, and table nesting and attributes.Good Afternoon Chris,

Below is a screenshot of the form created with HTML and CSS.
